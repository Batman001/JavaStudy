JTattoo is build for screens with millions of colors. So it looks ugly if you
use a color depth less than 16-bit.

<B>The window decoration style (new in Java 1.4)</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Due to a restriction in the swing implemantion of the window decoration style, it
is not possible to switch "on the fly" between Look and Feels which supports decoration 
style, and such wich does not support decoration style. So what you have to do is to
recreate your frame, otherwise you lose title and borders.
